# Reverse Proxy

If you want to require HTTPS to access the Bag Database, or if you want to run it on a server with multiple other web pages, the easiest way to do so is to run it behind a reverse proxy. An example Docker compose file for this configuration is located [here](../../../docker/docker-compose-reverse-proxy.yml). 

This Compose file is similar to the one in the [Without Authentication](without-authentication) example, but it uses [traefik](https://docs.traefik.io/) as a reverse proxy to serve the Bag Database at http://localhost/bagdb. Consult [traefik's HTTP and SSL documentation](https://docs.traefik.io/https/overview/) for more information about setting up encryption.

If you intend to have a reverse proxy that serves multiple servers behind different subdirectories, you should make sure to set the Bag DB's `BAGDB_PATH` environment variable to match the path you intend to serve it from; see the [Docker](docker) documentation. The linked example serves it from the path `bagdb`.
