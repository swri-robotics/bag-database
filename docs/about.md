Several years ago, we at [Southwest Research Institute](https://www.swri.org/technical-divisions/intelligent-systems)
needed to be able to quickly search through dozens of terabytes of bag files to find specific
topics and message types.

The Bag Database is what happened when a software engineer who had a decade of experience with
enterprise Java applications thought, "I can do something about that."

Since then, its functionality has greatly expanded, and although it's still mostly the work of
one person -- it turns out that there's not a lot of crossover between Java database programmers
and roboticists -- we're glad that the ROS community has found it useful and are very grateful
to everybody who has contributed to it.

The Bag Database's source code is hosted on GitHub at [https://github.com/swri-robotics/bag-database](https://github.com/swri-robotics/bag-database).

Pre-built Docker images are on Docker Hub at [https://hub.docker.com/r/swrirobotics/bag-database](https://hub.docker.com/r/swrirobotics/bag-database).

Let us know how it works for you!
